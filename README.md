## vCalendar
##### Approved?: ***`worked-on`***
##### Repo: https://github.com/PerfectMach1ne/uni-se-prj

---

Project for uni semester 6. It's a yet another disaster calendar app, this time in the form of a full stack web app with Vue 3, Axios, FastAPI, SQLite and whatever else I put in there (TypeScript, Tcl, Bash and Batch files found their way into this thing, even). It has *(or is/was meant to have*) more features than JavaCalendar, call ita prototype of my final uni thesis project with all the additional mini-self-organization features I want to put in it. Godspeed to my future self with this horrendously difficult initiative as I type this.

## STEMstuff
##### Approved?: ***`worked-on`***
##### Repo: https://github.com/PerfectMach1ne/uni-web-technologies

---

Project for uni semester 6. A plain website about any topic. My topic of choice was what I do when I have time to feed my research & note-taking hyperfixation, so the website is just going to mimick exactly that kind of thing.

---

## My Bachelor's Engineering Degree Final Project
##### Approved?: ***`worked-on`***
##### Repo: *`you'll find out in 10 months~`*

---

The only spoilers I'll drop for now: moar calendars; self-organization done neurodivergently; an app I'd like to actually use; and Kotlin <3.

---

## ***`nw4-twt-archivist`***
##### Approved?: ~~***`hiatus`***~~
##### Repo: https://github.com/PerfectMach1ne/nw4-twt-archivist

---

For managing my Twitter Minecraft screenshot archive without overpriced Twitter API. Uses Puppeteer and face-hh's free Twitter API code, also http-server for exponsing a certain local folder on my laptop. The intended app features are posting grabbing specific screenshots, arranging them correctly in the tweet, composing the rest of the tweet correctly and finally scheduling them every other day at a random hour.

---

## ***`med-sheet`***
##### Approved?: ~~***`hiatus`***~~
##### Repo: https://github.com/PerfectMach1ne/med-sheet

---

Google Sheets API based app for helping me track when I take my meds. Planned features are a specialized interpreter for my current Google Sheet (referred to as the "origin sheet"), a generalized "med sheet" creator and handler, a CLI for updating the "med sheets", a way to export data into CSV and JSON files, as well as some kind of mobile app that updates those sheets throught the Python Sheets API

---

## Tcl/tk NW4 utils
##### Approved?: yes
##### Repo: https://github.com/PerfectMach1ne/tcl-nw4-utils

---

A Tcl/Tk GUI app that does some tiny calculations I sometimes need for organizing stuff in my Minecraft world.
Potential crossover with `nw4-twt-archivist` project once it is finished.

## mineC rat
##### Approved?: yes
##### Repo: https://github.com/PerfectMach1ne/mineC-rat

---

My dream project - a Minecraft clone in C and OpenGL or something else. I honestly have no idea when I'm going to even be at the level of feeling comfortable to start working on it. But I *seriously* want to make this a thing ***so bad*** before I die. Which is why it's already approved, even if I am going to start it in something like 2030 (I typed that sentence in the middle of 2023).

---

## *JavaCalendar 2.0*
##### Approved?: *kind-of*
##### Repo: https://github.com/PerfectMach1ne/uni-javacalendar/tree/java-calendar-2point0

---

My old, disastrous and unfinished Swing Calendar project for uni semester 3. A JavaCalendar rewrite done partially for the meme, partially to pay homage to the legacy of my first serious project (and first uni project) since 2013's Super-Console.
Not coded with quality in mind, considering I want it to kind of be a meme, but I will definitely try to think through the design this time.
I originally planned (and had to, according to my uni class's requirements) to connect a local database to it, but I was not able to achieve that.

---

## `Brogleâˆª (Brogle Sum)`
##### Approved?: `no`

---

A full stack web app of the social media kind, like Google+ because I am an oddball among its' former users and hate it.
...well, at least I hated it for the last few years it spent being alive. Rip Bozo+, you used to be better before the worthless ironic boy fanclub era.
But complaints aside: I liked most of the website's UI/UX design, so I thought it'd be fun to someday try to recreate it from memory.
